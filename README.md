It’s organized, clear, and practical think of it like mini MDN but structured for quick learning and easy reference. I wrote this as a personal reference to come back to whenever I forget something. Studying it will give you a solid foundation in JS, whether you’re building projects, solving problems, or preparing for interviews.
