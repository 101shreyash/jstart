console.log is not part of the JavaScript language .
It’s provided by the host environment in most cases, browsers or Node.js which use engines like V8 
 (Chrome, Node.js). V8 itself is written in C++ and interprets or compiles JavaScript to machine code.
console.log is an API that the engine exposes to let you output data to the console;
 it’s essentially a bridge between JS and the environment’s I/O. 
 The JS engine doesn’t define it; it only executes it when the host provides it.

The “default behavior” of JavaScript is defined by the ECMAScript specification. 
That includes things like:
 variables, functions, objects, arrays, control flow, arithmetic, comparison operators, exceptions, promises, and standard built-in objects like Math, Date, JSON, String, Number, Array. These exist regardless of environment.
Anything like console, document, window, fetch is host-provided, not native JS.

one liner would be : V8 powers the JavaScript execution inside the browser, and the browser acts as the host environment that provides APIs like console.log and its not the default behaviour of js 

DOM, BOM, Web Storage, Fetch, Web Workers, Timers (setTimeout, setInterval), Console, Canvas, WebSockets, Geolocation.
All of those are host-provided APIs, not part of the JavaScript language itself

Note : Promises and async/await is the default part of the js and are part of ecma script specification



********************************************************************************************************

ECMAScript is the language specification that defines JavaScript.

It is a standard published by ECMA International. It describes the syntax, semantics, and core features of the language: types, variables, functions, objects, promises, modules, etc.

JavaScript is an implementation of the ECMAScript specification. Browsers and Node.js implement ECMAScript using engines like V8, SpiderMonkey, or JavaScriptCore, and then add host-specific APIs on top.
